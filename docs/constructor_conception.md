# Description of the quest constructor interface
## Basic concept
The quest constructor is a tool for graphical modification of the graph representing the quest. It is a kind of graphical programming tool. Unreal Engine Blueprints or Mission Builders in other games as an example.

## Exemplary vision
Places are the main elements. They have a number of settings and also contain questions. The answers to the questions lead to the next points. The concept of such a constructor can be found in the [images folder](https://github.com/Quest-maker-team/quest-maker/blob/main/docs/image/constructor-concept.jpg). </br>
A full description of the features will be added later*.

## Implementation
An example of the implementation of [moving blocks](http://javascript.ru/ui/draganddrop). </br>
It is also proposed to make a "tech demo" to confirm the feasibility of this concept.
