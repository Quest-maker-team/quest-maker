## Quest concept

### General description
The quest presents a sequence of questions and instructions for movement (possibly not explicit). The process of passing consists in answering questions and, possibly, moving around the locations. Users earn points as they progress. At the discretion of the author, the quest may be limited in time.

### Quest start
The user, using the bot, selects the desired quest and starts its passage. After that, a welcome message is sent to him, and then the first question.

### Along the quest
After receiving an answer, the bot either sends the next question (in this case, the scores may change in any direction or not change at all), or in case of an unsatisfactory answer, repeats the current one (possibly with the removal of points), or sends an indication of movement to a specific place (in this case the quest continues after reaching this point, at the discretion of the author, he can add the time the point is active, for example, night hours). The next question or indication may depend on the answer to the current question (if the author has provided for branching of the quest).

At the discretion of the author, hints can be attached to the question (the presence and amount of the fine for which the author determines). Also, at the discretion of the author, some questions may be skipped (the presence and size of the fine for which the author determines).

The user can interrupt the passage of the quest and continue it in the future if the passage is not limited in time.

### After passing
At the end of the quest, the user receives a result in points and a farewell message.
